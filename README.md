YouTube Video: Build AI Agents with Docker, Hereâ€™s How

## Instructions

Here's a basic Dockerfile that should work for this purpose:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Python script into the container
COPY hello_world.py .

# Run the Python script when the container launches
CMD ["python", "hello_world.py"]
```

This Dockerfile does the following:

1. Uses the official Python 3.9 slim image as the base.
2. Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
3. Copies your `hello_world.py` file into the container.
4. Specifies the command to run when the container starts, which is to execute the Python script.

To use this Dockerfile:

1. Make sure your Python script is named `hello_world.py` and is in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
2. Build the Docker image using: `docker build -t hello-world-python .`
3. Run the container using: `docker run hello-world-python`

Would you like me to explain any part of this Dockerfile or provide more information about using Docker with Python?

### Data set creation using LLM prompting
give me 10 idesas for a simple dataset for LLM fine-tuning

let's go with idea #1

create a new CSV dataset, with 30 rows, with 5 different columns

## Additional Dataset

Certainly. Let's create a dataset focused on internet threats like computer viruses and other forms of malware. This dataset could be useful for training an LLM to recognize and provide information about various cyber threats. Here's a CSV dataset with 30 rows and 6 columns:

```csv

2024-08-11,Dridex,Banking Trojan,High,Windows,Financial data
2024-08-19,Maze,Ransomware,Critical,Windows,Data exfiltration
```

This dataset provides a variety of information about different types of cyber threats, including:

1. Date: When the threat was detected or became prominent
2. Threat Name: The common name or identifier of the malware
3. Type: The category of the threat (e.g., ransomware, trojan, worm)
4. Severity: The potential impact of the threat (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
5. Affected Systems: The primary systems or platforms targeted
6. Primary Target: The main goal or target of the malware

This dataset could be used to fine-tune an LLM for tasks such as:

1. Identifying and classifying different types of cyber threats
2. Providing information about specific malware and their characteristics
3. Assessing the severity and potential impact of various threats
4. Recommending protective measures based on the type of threat
5. Analyzing trends in cyber threats over time

Would you like me to explain how this dataset could be used for specific LLM fine-tuning tasks, or do you have any questions about the data?

### Asking Anthropic to help with the Dockerfile

I have a python project and I need your help to build a docker file for it.
